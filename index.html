                Nikola Tesla was a visionary inventor, electrical engineer, and physicist whose groundbreaking work in
                electromagnetism and wireless technology transformed the world. Born in 1856 in what is now Croatia,
                Tesla's innovations, including alternating current (AC) power, the Tesla coil, and advancements in
                radio, paved the way for modern electricity and telecommunications. Despite facing financial
                difficulties and often working in isolation, his contributions laid the foundation for much of the
                technology we take for granted today. This tribute page honors his genius, relentless pursuit of
                knowledge, and enduring legacy that continues to inspire innovation and progress.
